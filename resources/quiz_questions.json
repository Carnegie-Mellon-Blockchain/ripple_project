        "description": "Blockchain explained in plain English\n\nUnderstanding how blockchain works and identifying myths about its powers are the first steps to developing blockchain technologies.\n\nBlockchain is an algorithm and distributed data structure for managing electronic cash without a central administrator among people who know nothing about one another. Originally designed for the crypto-currency Bitcoin, the blockchain architecture was driven by a radical rejection of at (government-guaranteed) money and bank-controlled payments.\n\nBlockchain is a special instance of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), almost all of which have emerged in Bitcoin's wake.\n\nHOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN WORK?\n\nBlockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that was invented to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was motivated by an extreme rejection of government-guaranteed money and bank-controlled payments. The developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned people spending money without friction, intermediaries, regulation or the need to know or trust other parties.\n\nTechnically, the original blockchain is separable from Bitcoin, but this report will show that the blockchain design is so specific to Bitcoin that it's not a good fit for much else.\n\nThe central problem in electronic cash is Double Spend. Because pure electronic money is just data, nothing stops a currency holder from trying to spend it twice. Blockchain solves the Double Spend problem without a digital reserve fund or similar form of umpire.\n\nBlockchain monitors and verifies Bitcoin transactions by calling upon a decentralized network of volunteer-run nodes to, in effect, vote on the order in which transactions occur. The network's algorithm ensures that each transaction is unique.\n\nVideo created by the Centre of International Governance Innovation.",

        "description": "What Is Tokenomics?\n\nTokenomics dictate the supply and demand characteristics of a cryptocurrency.\n\nBut before diving into tokenomics, let's take a look at what a token means. \n\nWhat Is a Token?\n\nA token is a digital unit of a cryptocurrency that is either used as a specific asset, or represents a particular use on the blockchain. Tokens can have multiple use cases, but the most common ones are as security, utility, or governance tokens.\n\nCryptocurrencies and tokens built on blockchains have pre-set, algorithmically created, issuance schedules. This means that we can predict with quite some accuracy how many coins will have been created by a certain day and time. \n\nThough it is possible for most cryptoassets to have this issuance schedule altered, it would require quite a bit of effort. Thus, changing this schedule is very difficult. \n\nThis provides some predictability and security for token holders, in a way that is much more predictable and stable than how governments create and issue their currencies.\n\nWhy Is Tokenomics Important When Investing in Cryptocurrency?\n\nUnderstanding the factors that will impact either supply or demand are of vital importance to both speculators and investors. \n\nPerhaps the most important factor is to understand how the digital currency will be used. \n\nIs there a clear link between the platform or service being built, and the asset? \n\nIf so, there is a strong chance that a growing service will require purchases that increase usage and demand, thus increasing the price. If this is not the case, what can the token be used for?\n\nOther important questions include: \n\nHow many coins or tokens currently exist? \nHow many will exist in the future and when will they be created? \nWho owns the coins? Are there some set aside to be released in the future to developers? \nHave a large number of coins been lost, burned, deleted or are somehow unusable?\n\nTokenomics is also helpful as guidance to understand how much an asset might be worth in the future. \n\nFor example, many people new to crypto might think that any coin could become as valuable as Bitcoin, even though tokenomics may prove this to be impossible. \n\nAs an example, let\u2019s look at two coins, Bitcoin Cash and Tron. Bitcoin Cash has the same total supply as Bitcoin, so thinking that it may become as valuable as the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency \u2014 might be possible. \n\nHowever, with more than 100 billion Tron already created, in order to break a few thousand dollars per-coin, Tron would need to become the most valuable business in the history of the world. The odds of that happening may be a bit far off.\n\nWhile these questions may seem to require complex answers, they provide an extra way to view cryptoassets and to help understand whether one asset is more likely to have a great value and future, than another.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 From crypto news, to market moves, and to educational how to videos.
