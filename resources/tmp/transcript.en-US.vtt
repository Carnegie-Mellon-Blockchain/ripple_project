00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.920
A crypto wallet is your key to the crypto space&nbsp;
but do you know that they can be hot or cold?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.000
All wallets perform the same fundamental&nbsp;
function - storing your private keys - but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.800
in different ways. With them,&nbsp;
you can manage your funds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.280
perform transactions, and&nbsp;
interact with the blockchain.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.680
Wallets can be categorized&nbsp;
broadly into hot and cold wallets.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.880
A hot wallet, sometimes referred to as&nbsp;
a software wallet, is usually a computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.720
program or mobile application on your&nbsp;
device. What makes them ‘hot’ is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.880
they generate and store your private keys&nbsp;
and seed phrases in an online environment.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.600
They often come in the form of web-based&nbsp;
wallets like browser extensions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.480
or standalone apps that can be used&nbsp;
on a desktop, laptop, or smartphone.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
In contrast, a cold wallet is simply a wallet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.320
whose private keys are not exposed&nbsp;
to the internet. Additionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.080
beyond simple transfers, it should not be&nbsp;
used to interact with any smart contracts.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.720
They can come in different forms, such as a paper&nbsp;
wallet or a hardware wallet, though the latter is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.280
the most common. In hardware wallets, private&nbsp;
keys are generated and stored locally only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.000
within the device, and are not exposed to the&nbsp;
internet even when used to sign transactions.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.520
Note that while cold wallets are sometimes&nbsp;
interchangeably used with the term “hardware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.040
wallet”, the two aren’t entirely the same.&nbsp;
This is because hardware wallets can still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.440
be used to interact with dApps, making&nbsp;
them susceptible to onchain threats.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
Let’s dive further into their pros and cons.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.920
Hot wallets make performing transactions&nbsp;
and interacting with dApps on web3 a breeze.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.240
With an internet connection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800
users just need to log in to their wallet&nbsp;
to begin interacting with applications.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400
Beginners in crypto might find hot&nbsp;
wallets to be a good starting point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.440
due to their simple user experience, but&nbsp;
even experienced users enjoy hot wallets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.840
for day-to-day crypto transactions,&nbsp;
especially when interacting with dApps.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.360
However, this convenience&nbsp;
comes at the cost of security.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.400
Because hot wallets are always exposed online,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.920
your private information&nbsp;
is more easily compromised.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.240
Malware on your device or software bugs&nbsp;
could allow hackers to extract your seed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.120
phrase or private keys, jeopardizing your funds.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.320
Frequent interaction with dApps&nbsp;
leaves you more vulnerable to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.280
malicious transactions that&nbsp;
could drain your wallet.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.200
As for cold wallets, its primary benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.120
is the security features it&nbsp;
offers for your crypto holdings.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
Remember, a cold wallet is ‘cold’&nbsp;
because your private keys are never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.320
exposed to the internet in any way.&nbsp;
They also do not interact with dApps.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.760
These two together protect your assets both&nbsp;
from malware that can expose your private keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.720
or other on-chain threats like malicious smart&nbsp;
contracts; as not even a hardware wallet can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.840
save your assets if you accidentally&nbsp;
approve a malicious transaction.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.400
As for the downsides of cold wallets, the&nbsp;
primary one is their inherent difficulty of use.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.960
Old school solutions like paper wallets are&nbsp;
more suited for enthusiastic cypherpunks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.200
long-term storage rather than&nbsp;
the average day-to-day user.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.600
Cold hardware wallets are physical devices&nbsp;
that need to be brought around with you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.240
and also require an internet-enabled device to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.600
used. That means you need to have both&nbsp;
devices on hand to access your funds.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.920
This can prove as a challenge to those who prefer&nbsp;
to execute transactions quickly and at any time.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.720
We hope you’ve enjoyed learning&nbsp;
more about hot and cold wallets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.120
and how they work to store your private keys.
