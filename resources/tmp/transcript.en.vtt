00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.960
what is tokenomics? tokenomics dictate the supply&nbsp;
and demand characteristics of a cryptocurrency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.920
but before diving into tokenomics let's&nbsp;
take a look at what a token means.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.560
so what is a token? a token is a digital unit of&nbsp;
a cryptocurrency that is either used as a specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.240
asset or it represents a particular use on the&nbsp;
blockchain. tokens can have multiple use cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.480
but the most common ones are as security, utility&nbsp;
or governance tokens. cryptocurrencies and tokens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.040
built on blockchains have preset algorithmically&nbsp;
created issuance schedules. this means that we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.120
predict with quite some accuracy how many coins&nbsp;
will have been created by a certain day and time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.040
though it is possible for most crypto&nbsp;
assets to have this issuance scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.680
altered it would require quite a bit of effort&nbsp;
thus changing this schedule is very difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.680
this provides some predictability and&nbsp;
security for token holders in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.200
is much more predictable and stable than how&nbsp;
governments create and issue their currencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.320
so why is tokenomics important when investing in&nbsp;
cryptocurrency? understanding the factors that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.520
will impact either supply or demand are of vital&nbsp;
importance to both speculators and investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
perhaps the most important factor is to understand&nbsp;
how the digital currency will be used is there a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.440
clear link between the platform or service&nbsp;
being built and the asset itself if so there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.240
is a strong chance that a growing service will&nbsp;
require purchases that increase usage and demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.920
thus increasing the price. if this is not the&nbsp;
case what can the token be used for? other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.440
important questions include how many coins or&nbsp;
tokens currently exist? how many will exist in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.320
the future and when will they be created? who&nbsp;
owns the coins? are there some set aside to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.720
released in the future for developers? have&nbsp;
a large number of coins been lost, burned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.400
deleted or are somehow unusable? tokenomics is&nbsp;
also helpful as guidance to understand how much an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.360
asset might be worth in the future. for example,&nbsp;
many people new to crypto might think that any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.480
coin could become as valuable as bitcoin even&nbsp;
though tokenomics may prove this to be impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.320
as an example let's look at two coins: bitcoin&nbsp;
cash and tron. bitcoin cash has the same total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.080
supply as bitcoin so thinking that it may become&nbsp;
as valuable as the world's biggest cryptocurrency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.600
could be possible. however with more than&nbsp;
100 billion tron already created in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.640
to break a few thousand dollars per coin tron&nbsp;
would need to become the most valuable business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.400
in the history of the world. the odds of that&nbsp;
happening may be a bit off. while these questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.840
may seem to require complex answers they do&nbsp;
provide an extra way to view crypto assets and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.560
help understand whether one asset is more likely&nbsp;
to have a great value and future than another.
